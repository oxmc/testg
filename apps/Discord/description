Nativefier version of Discord for ARM
To run: Menu -> Internet -> Discord.
To run in a terminal: /usr/share/discord-linux-armv7l/discord
You could also run it from the desktop shortcut.
The app runs independent to chromium and can be hidden to the system tray unlike other solutions out there.
Made by SpacingBat3 on Github with care :)
